# Digital-Planner

This project is for my Senior Computer Engineering Project at Elizabethtown College. I am building a mobile digital planner with a sperate terminal to manage and store all data.

The purpose of this project is to show what I have learned during my time in college. The other purpose is to build a quailty product that does what it is suppose to do
and not include extra functions that distract the user. 

Two part system: Mobile unit and Terminal

The purpose of the Mobile unit is to take in and store inputs from the user. This will be done with an LCD and hand-held keyboard via a Raspberry Pi 

The purpose of the Terminal is to take the data from the Mobile unit, organize the data and output a easily digestable GUI as well as a output data to a csv file.
