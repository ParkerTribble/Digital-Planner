This project is for my Senior Computer Engineering Project at Elizabethtown College.

**Porject Status**: Incomplete 
      PCB and parts ordered
      Software in development

**Description**

I am building a multi-part Digital Planner device. There are far too many distractions on a smart-phone to be an effective tool for organization 


The planner has two seperate units: Mobile and Terminal

The Mobile unit consists of a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B V1.2, a small LCD screen, and custom PCB keyboard 
  This unit will take in user's data such as a organization key term, description, date & time, and location and store it locally until transfered to terminal. 
  This unit will also display a simple UI for the user to input data as well as a UI for important data (marked with a urgency/importance weight) 

The Terminal is a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B V1.2, which may also contain different adapter depending on data transfer tests
  This unit will take in the data from the mobile unit, add it to exsisting data base, and then organize it all.
  This unit will also output a UI for the user to import and delete data. As well as output a more complex UI for the user to have an interactive experince organizing thier life.
